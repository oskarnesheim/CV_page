            Hello, my name is Oskar and I am a 22 year old student at NTNU. I am
            currently at my third year at the bachelor program in Informatics. I
            have found informatics to be a very interesting field of study, and
            I am looking forward to learn more about it. In the last two years I
            have learned alot about different technologies like React,
            Typescript and Tailwindcss. This page is in fact build on those
            technologies. On my freetime I love to be outdoors, and I am a big
            fan of skiing and climbing. Whenever I have a free weekend I try to
            drive up to the mountains to go skiing. I also very much enjoy the
            studentlife here in Trondheim, where I play beachbolleyball and
            football.
